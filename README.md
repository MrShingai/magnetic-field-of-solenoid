# magnetic-field-of-solenoid
This project computes and visualizes the magnetic field along the axis of a finite solenoid. The program implements the analytical formula derived from the Biot–Savart law and uses the number of turns  N, current   I, radius   R, and solenoid length  𝐿 to calculate the magnetic field   B(z) at different axial positions.
